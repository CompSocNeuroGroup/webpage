### Affective processing in adolescence
Adolescence and early adulthood are important times in the development of emotional processes. Challenges with emotional processing during adolescence can be associated with the development of psychopathology, substance abuse, and risky behavior. In collaboration with Dr. Tara Chaplin and the [Youth Emotions Lab](https://yel.gmu.edu/) we are examining development and gender differences in emotional processing during adolescence. We are particularly interested in the role that relationships between teens and their parents and friends play in the development of brain processes that underlie healthy emotional expression and regulation.

### Stress, emotions and impulsive behaviors
The CSNG also is a close collaborator with [Dr. Sarah Fischer](https://psychology.gmu.edu/people/snowaczy) and the [GMU Impulse Lab](https://www.facebook.com/ImpulselabGMU). Together, we investigate brain processes involved in the relationship between stress, emotional responses, and pathological behaviors such as binge eating, bulimia nervosa, and alcohol abuse. In this collaboration, we use lab based measures, neuroimaging, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). We are also interested in using network-based methods to understand the relationship between stress, psychopathology, and eating disorders.
